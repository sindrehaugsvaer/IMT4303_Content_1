Anatomical and physiological studies have identified many loops between the cerebral cortex and
two subcortical structures, the basal ganglia and the cerebellum (Middleton & Strick, 2000; Houk
2005). These loops, called distributed processing modules (DPMs), have been regarded as the brainâ€™s
substrate for the planning, initiation and regulation of movement, as well as thought. It is estimated
that there may be on the order of a hundred DPMs in the human brain that form a large-scale neural
network. Because they each have strikingly similar neuronal architectures, their signal processing
operations may be essentially identical. The resultant network of generic DPMs thus provides a
promising framework for understanding many questions about how the mind thinks and controls
action. For example, how do we recognize that we are thirsty, look for a glass, fill that glass with
water, drink the water and thus satisfy our thirst?
